        <a href="https://www.dccomics.com/characters/superman"  > Superman</a> is a superhero who first appeared in American comic books published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics">DC Comics</a>. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and debuted in the comic book Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938).[1] Superman has been adapted to a number of other media which includes radio serials, novels, movies, television shows and theatre.

        Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime. To protect his privacy, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark Kent resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, photographer Jimmy Olsen, and archenemy Lex Luthor.
        
        Superman is the classic archetype of the superhero character: he wears an outlandish costume, uses a codename, and fights evil with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier fictional characters who arguably fit this definition, it was Superman who popularized the superhero genre and established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero character in American comic books up until the 1980s.</p>
            <br><h3>Abilities</h3><h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Heat Vision</h4><br>

            Heat Vision is a superpower possessed by Kryptonians and Daxamites when exposed to the yellow sun; see Photonucleic Effect. It is the ability to release massive amounts of solar energy stored within the body through the eyes, in focused beams of heat (Presumably, as infra-red light).

            It was originally considered to be a subset of X-Ray Vision; for example, Superman was known to melt metal with "The heat of his X-Ray vision". As his powers developed and became more defined, however, Heat Vision became distinguished as an individual power. The temperature of heat vision or a laser beam is stated to be 5000 degrees (presumably Celsius), making it capable of burning through the toughest steel, material and armor.
            
            When angry, or to make a threat, Kryptonians may cause their eyes to glow a threatening red, without any strong beams actually emerging from their eyes.
            
            Martians - Martians can shoot fire/beams from their eyes.
            
            Kryptonians and Daxamites - Kryptonians and Daxamites can shoot fire/beams from their eyes.

    <h4>Superhuman Strength</h4>The powers of the DC Comics character Superman have changed a great deal since his introduction in the 1930s. As the character developed, his abilities were enhanced in order to maintain the interest of his audience. The extent of his powers peaked during the 1960s and - albeit to a lesser extent - the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where it became difficult to create suitable challenges for the character. As a result, his powers were significantly reduced when his story was rebooted by writer John Byrne after the Crisis on Infinite Earths series. After Byrne's departure, Superman's powers were gradually increased again, although he still remains weaker than his Pre-Crisis incarnation.<br>
